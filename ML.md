Topic 5.1 – Machine Learning Overview
Q1: What is Machine Learning?
A: Machine learning is the ability of a machine to expand its knowledge without human intervention.
Q2: When can we say an agent is learning?
A: When it improves its performance after making observations about the world.
Q3: What does a computer do in machine learning? (3 steps)
A: Observes some data → Builds a model based on the data → Uses the model as both a hypothesis about the world and a piece of software that can solve problems.
Q4: Name two reasons why machine learning is required.
A: (1) Designers cannot anticipate all possible future situations. (2) Designers cannot anticipate all changes over time.
Q5: What are the three main types of learning?
A: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, and Reinforcement learning.
Q6: In supervised learning, what does the agent observe?
A: Input-output pairs, and it learns a function that maps from input to output. The environment is the teacher.
Q7: What is a "label" in supervised learning?
A: The output associated with an input (e.g., "bus" or "pedestrian" for a camera image).
Q8: What is the most common unsupervised learning task?
A: Clustering — detecting potentially useful clusters of input examples.
Q9: In unsupervised learning, what kind of feedback is supplied?
A: No explicit feedback is supplied; the agent learns patterns in the input on its own.
Q10: How does reinforcement learning work?
A: The agent learns from a series of reinforcements — rewards or punishments. The goal is to create intelligent agents with machinery able to learn from their experience.
Q11: Name three common reinforcement learning algorithms.
A: Q-learning or value-iteration methods, Deep Q Neural Network (DQN), and Model-based RL.
Q12: What is the difference between classification and regression problems?
A: If the output (predicted variable) is categorical/discrete (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), it's a classification problem. If the output is continuous (e.g., temperature as a number like 33, 37.5), it's a regression problem.

Topic 5.2 – Supervised Learning
Q13: What is the main concept behind supervised learning?
A: To let the machine learn from experiences and examples rather than hard-coded rules.
Q14: What is the formal definition of supervised learning?
A: Given a training set of N examples (x1,y1), (x2,y2),...(xN,yN), where each pair was generated by an unknown function y = f(x), we try to discover a function h that approximates the true function f.
Q15: What is the function h called?
A: A hypothesis about the world. It is drawn from a hypothesis space H.
Q16: What are the 4 main steps of supervised learning?
A: (1) Split data into training and testing. (2) Use training data to learn parameters/weights of h. (3) Run the model on test data (without labels). (4) Compare predicted results with actual test labels.
Q17: What is Bias in model validation?
A: Bias refers to a model's assumptions about the data. High bias means the model oversimplifies and may underfit.
Q18: What is Variance in model validation?
A: Variance is the amount of change in the hypothesis due to fluctuation in the training dataset. High variance means the model is overfitting.
Q19: What is overfitting?
A: When the fluctuation is high and the model tries to fit every data point too closely (including noise), the model has high variance and is overfitting.
Q20: What is the Bias-Variance trade-off?
A: The goal is to select the hypothesis that will optimally fit future examples — balancing between a model that's too simple (high bias) and one that's too complex (high variance). A linear function can be expected to generalize better than a polynomial that perfectly fits training data.
Q21: What is the loss function in machine learning?
A: We want to minimize the loss of the utility function. Loss function L measures the difference between predicted and actual values.
Q22: What are the types of loss functions?
A: L₁ = |y − ŷ| (absolute loss), L₂ = (y − ŷ)² (squared loss), L₀/₁ = 0 if y = ŷ, else 1 (0-1 loss).

Topic 5.3 – Feature Engineering
Q23: What is the feature space?
A: The feature space needs to be prepared prior to building any machine learning models.
Q24: What percentage of time is spent on building the feature space?
A: 70 to 80 percent of the time.
Q25: What does building the feature space involve?
A: (1) Data transformation & modelling, (2) Data standardization or normalization, (3) Missing values, (4) Correlation analysis, (5) Feature selection.
Q26: What are entropy and information gain used for?
A: They are used in algorithms to select the most relevant features (attributes) for the model.

Topic 5.4 – Statistics Review
Q27: What three fundamental areas does AI formalization require?
A: Logic, Computation, and Probability.
Q28: What is a Probability Density Function (PDF)?
A: For a random variable, it is the count of times the random variable attains a particular value x, giving the probability of attaining a particular value.
Q29: What is a Cumulative Density Function (CDF)?
A: It is defined as the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a given value x (the total probability that is ≤ a given value).
Q30: Name five kinds of probability distributions.
A: Normal (Bell Curve), Uniform, Poisson, Binomial, and Multinomial distributions.
Q31: What is Correlation?
A: Finding a relation between two variables. A good correlation suggests dependence — if one changes, the other changes too.
Q32: What is the range of the correlation coefficient?
A: From -1 to 1 (−1 < h < 1). A value of 0 means no correlation; below −0.5 or above 0.5 is a notable correlation.
Q33: What does a positive correlation coefficient mean?
A: There is a direct relationship — if one variable increases, the other increases; if one decreases, the other decreases.
Q34: What does a negative correlation coefficient mean?
A: There is an inverse relationship — if one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa.
Q35: What is random sampling?
A: Taking a group of individuals (e.g., 1000), calculating the average (mean), and repeating this many times to estimate the population parameter.
Q36: What is the null hypothesis?
A: The hypothesis that already exists or is assumed to be true (H₀).
Q37: What is the alternate hypothesis?
A: The hypothesis someone is proposing (Hₐ).
Q38: What is a P-value?
A: The calculated probability of finding the observed (or more extreme) results when the null hypothesis is true.
Q39: When do we reject the null hypothesis?
A: When the p-value is less than the significance level (β), e.g., p-value < 0.05.
Q40: What is the difference between a T-test and a Z-test?
A: T-test: based on Student-t distribution, population variance unknown, sample size < 30. Z-test: based on Normal distribution, population variance known, sample size > 30.
Q41: What is the Z-test formula?
A: Z = (Am − A₀) / (σ / √n), where Am = sample mean, n = sample size, σ = population standard deviation, A₀ = population mean.
Q42: What is the Chi-square test used for in machine learning?
A: (1) Show a causal relationship or independence between input and output variable. (2) Check whether observed data is from a fair/unbiased source. (3) Check whether data is too good to be true.
Q43: What is the chi-square formula?
A: χ² = Σ(O − E)² / E, where O is the observed value and E is the expected value.

Topic 5.5 – Linear Regression
Q44: What is the uni-variate linear model equation?
A: y = w₁x + w₀, where w₀ is the intercept on the y-axis and w₁ is the slope.
Q45: What loss function is used in linear regression?
A: The L₂ loss function: Loss(h_w) = Σ(yⱼ − h_w(xⱼ))² = Σ(yⱼ − (w₁xⱼ + w₀))².
Q46: What is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method?
A: Finding the line that best fits the data by minimizing the sum of squared differences (SS residuals) between actual and predicted values.
Q47: What shape does the loss function form when plotted in 3D with w₀ and w₁?
A: A convex shape, and we need to reach the lowest point on the convex function.
Q48: How do we find the optimal w₀ and w₁?
A: By setting the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to w₀ and w₁ to zero (∂Loss/∂w₀ = 0 and ∂Loss/∂w₁ = 0), then using the chain rule to solve.
Q49: What is SST (Total Sum of Squares)?
A: SST = Σ(y_actual − y_average)², representing the total variability when there is no model.
Q50: What are the two components of SST?
A: SSR (Regression Sum of Squares) — the difference the model explains, and SSE (Error Sum of Squares) — the residual/unexplained difference.
Q51: What is R² (R-squared)?
A: R² = 1 − (SSR/SST). It measures how well the regression model explains the variability.
Q52: What is the null hypothesis in linear regression?
A: H₀: w₁ = 0 (no relationship between x and y).
Q53: What is the alternate hypothesis in linear regression?
A: Hₐ: w₁ ≠ 0 (there is a relationship between x and y).
Q54: What is multivariate linear regression?
A: Extension to multiple input variables: h_sw(xⱼ) = w₀ + w₁x_{j,1} + ··· + wₙx_{j,n}.
Q55: What is a risk with multivariate linear regression?
A: Overfitting — some irrelevant dimensions may appear useful by chance, leading to overfitting in high-dimensional spaces.

These 55 questions cover all testable concepts from every section of Module 05. Focus especially on the definitions of the three learning types, bias vs. variance, the loss function, correlation, hypothesis testing (Z-test, T-test, Chi-square), and the linear regression equations — these are the most likely quiz targets.
